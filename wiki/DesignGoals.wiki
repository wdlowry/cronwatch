#summary Design Goals for initial version and future versions of cronwatch

= Crontab Implementation =
The crontab implementation should be as simple as possible. Ideally, if the PATH variable in cron is already set up, then the only change to crontab should be a insertion of the cronwatch script. 

For example:
{{{
5 * * * * root /some/script --with --arguments
}}}

becomes

{{{
5 * * * * root cronwatch /some/script --with --arguments
}}}

If there are multiple instances of the same script or if special configuration is needed, the admin will need to add a configuration "token" to specify which configuration file to use.

For example:
{{{
5 * * * * root /some/script first-instance
9 * * * * root /some/script second-instance
}}}

becomes

{{{
5 * * * * root cronwatch -c /some/script first first-instance
9 * * * * root cronwatch -c /some/script second second-instance
}}}
