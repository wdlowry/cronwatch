= Crontab Implementation =
The crontab implementation should be as simple as possible. Ideally, if the PATH variable in cron is already set up, then the only change to crontab should be a insertion of the cronwatch script. 

Example:
{{{
5 * * * * root /some/script --with --arguments
}}}

becomes

{{{
5 * * * * root cronwatch /some/script --with --arguments
}}}

If there are multiple instances of the same script or if special configuration is needed, the admin will need to add a configuration "token" to specify which configuration file to use.

Example:
{{{
5 * * * * root /some/script first-instance
9 * * * * root /some/script second-instance
}}}

becomes

{{{
5 * * * * root cronwatch -c /some/script first first-instance
9 * * * * root cronwatch -c /some/script second second-instance
}}}

Any shell redirection must be abstracted into a wrapper script because cronwatch handles 
Example: 
{{{
5 * * * * root grep pattern /some/file | sort | uniq > output
}}}

becomes:
{{{
5 * * * * root cronwatch /some/scriptwrapper.sh
}}}

Most configuration options will be also available as command line options for users who prefer to keep all the configuration in the crontab file.
