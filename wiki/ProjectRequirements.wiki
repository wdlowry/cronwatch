= Development =
 * Design and implement using test-driven development. This will ensure that *all* code is associated with test code.
 * Maintain minimal requirements on the client side. Basically, I don't want the sysadmin to have to install something other than cronwatch on the client systems. Thus, the code should only use widely available UNIX software
 * Test on a variety of systems: AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, BSDs
